# Short Link Website

Created a short link when you provided a website. 

- Used sqlite3 to store the data
- Python for the framework
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the website content

Main function of the website works, but I had bigger plans I wanted to do on it. Which I ended up not doing.
( I was trying to make a copy of Tinyurl https://tinyurl.com/app)
